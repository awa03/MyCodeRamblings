# MyCodeRamblings
This is essentiall a compilation of my code, heavily explained in detail. Don't expect header files because this is just for my studying purposed. I understand if the code looks messy, but so is my mind! I had alot of fun writing these, and some of them are pretty large projects, especially considering most of them were made within a day. I will update readMe with info on each, so you dont have to really look through it. So thanks for checking this out!
